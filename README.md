<br>

**Project Overview**
<br>
This project is a mobile application designed to provide engaging educational content for children through interactive games and activities. The backend is built using the .NET ASP framework, which facilitates the development of robust and scalable web services.
<br><br>

**Technologies Used**
<br>
.NET ASP Framework: Utilized for building the RESTful API that serves as the backbone of the application.
<br>
C#: The primary programming language used for developing the backend logic.
<br>
SQL Server: Employed for managing and storing relational database information, ensuring efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
<br><br>

**API Endpoints**
<br>
GET /api/lessons: Retrieves a list of educational lessons available for children.
<br>
POST /api/lessons: Allows the creation of new lessons in the database.
<br>

<br>
PUT /api/lessons/{id}: Updates an existing lesson's information.
<br>
DELETE /api/lessons/{id}: Deletes a lesson from the database.

<br>
The backend utilizes SQL Server for data management, providing a secure and efficient way to handle user data and application content. Regular updates and security patches ensure the database remains reliable and secure.
<br><br>

**Contribution Guidelines**
<br>
Contributions to the backend are welcome! Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your proposed changes. Ensure that your code adheres to the established coding standards and includes appropriate documentation.
<br><br>

**Objective:**
<br>
To provide engaging, educational experiences that foster cognitive and emotional development in children aged 3-4 years.

#### The backend was focused on the login and Signup:

- The Login and Signup pages are designed for parents to access the application on behalf 
of their children. These pages provide a secure and personalized experience for parents by 
allowing them to create individual accounts so that they can track their child's progress, 
customize settings, and ensure a safe and age-appropriate learning environment. Parents can 
either sign in with their existing credentials or create a new account to gain access to the 
application's features
